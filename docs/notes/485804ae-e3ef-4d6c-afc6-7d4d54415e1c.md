## Recap

From inside Trumble, a minimum security federal prison, three former judges calling themselves "The Brethren" organise a legal advice and inmate 'social trial' system. Their main occupation however, is running a mail extortion scam with the assistance of their outside lawyer, Trevor and a fictitious persona, Ricky from rehab. They have carefully and meticulously set it up, getting to know their victims before threatening to expose them through blackmail, to make a great deal of money from a few unfortunate victims who thought they were simply responding to an advert to no longer be lonely. 

Outside of the open prison, in the real world, the CIA  is planning to back a political candidate in order to increase military spending. Aaron Lake seems to be the perfect man, no hidden agenda, no hidden skeletons in the closet and a likeable character. He is the perfect candidate. The orchestrated drive to become president has the CIA pulling a number of stunts to drive up interest in military power.

What could possibly go wrong?

Well, Mr Lake (aka Al Konyers) had unfortunately responded to the advert using an alias and thinks he is in the clear. Until late one evening, returning home from the election campaign he wrote a letter to Ricky terminating their correspondence. Mistake was that he inadvertently included a thank you letter for one of his sponsors and at the same time the CIA wrote a letter carrying on their correspondence.  The Brethren soon realised who he was and started the plan to get themselves freed and loaded through balckmail.

## Thoughts

Another great John Grisham book which I can add to me read collection. Well written and a good page turner. A few twists and turns throughout the story.  I enjoyed reading this book and even though there are a number of different characters and no main protagonist, it worked well. It is well written and the story flows.

The ending is a bit rushed it seems but does leave you to decide how you want it to end.
