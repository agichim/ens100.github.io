# Python

![](/assets/images/2020-09-10-15-59-48.png)

There are my notes on learning Python. I learned the basis of Python a few years ago and then dropped it as other things took over. After starting to try and learn [Clojure ](6000b39f-04b1-4c49-b75b-dfa603889aa0), I found myself at the very deep end and quickly got lost. For this reason I thought to take on Python again as it has much more beginner type courses and videos to at least gain some insight into the programming world. 

Who knows, maybe one day I will return to [Clojure ](6000b39f-04b1-4c49-b75b-dfa603889aa0)
