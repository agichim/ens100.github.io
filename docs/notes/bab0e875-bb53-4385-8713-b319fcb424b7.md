## My Thoughts

In this area I summarise my thoughts and learnings. The purpose is to capture the key take-aways from in a summarised journal manner.

- Intense week at work. It feels as if when you take some vacation you then need to work triple to make up for the time you were away rendering any vacation moot. 

- Progressing with my reading on yet another John Grisham book - [The Brethren ](485804ae-e3ef-4d6c-afc6-7d4d54415e1c). Interesting and liking the few interesting paths the book is taking.

- Learnt of the Internet Culture and the <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)" target="_blank">90-9-1 phenomenon</a>. Fascinating stuff and so true.

- Saturday, beautiful sunshine and beautiful company. Does one need any more?

- Been reading up a but on Python and the <a href="https://pyweek.org/" target="_blank">PY Week</a> which is coming up  
  - Seems to be something quite cool to follow

- Seem to have finally gotten the hang of GitHub with all its pushes, pulls, issues etc. Only took about a month

- Managed to get my notes sorted in a cool manner with lots more to follow. Importing notes from different places is tough.

- With each day that passes <a href="https://www.dendron.so/" target="_blank">Dendron</a> becomes easier and easier to use and it has so many great features.
  - This digital garden for instance, would have been so much more complicated to set up without it.

- I miss being able to [travel](b33e39c9-8443-41f7-94a6-9b34b046de55) and make our way hand-in-hand to the airport and board a flight somewhere to explore new areas.

- A few days away from the office and I already feel like a new person, seems quite telling.

- Watched up to half of Grey's Anatomy Season 2 and enjoying it so far, even though it is a little gruesome at times.

### 2020-09-09

- After having attempted to learn Clojure, I have decided to take a step back and try to learning something with more resources and "getting started" guides. 
  - I will therefore be learning [Python ](9cabe777-4b21-4b94-be7b-0cd9a3f3de73) as my first language and once I feel comfortable, I will develop my [Clojure ](6000b39f-04b1-4c49-b75b-dfa603889aa0) learning.

- With so many new tools out there it is very easy to be lead astray and keep procrastinating by continuously shifting between them, rather than using them for what they should be used...making life more productive and easier.

- Rather than being in [South Africa and Qatar ](b33e39c9-8443-41f7-94a6-9b34b046de55) we are at home. Bummer, but with everything going on it is nice to be safe and sound and to be able explore areas closer to home.
