With so many different things happening at once and information being available at the click of a button, How do we keep track of all the things we have learned?

If you find it difficult, you are not alone. I have not done a good job at keeping track of things I learn, but I want to. 

I have therefore decided to add a `Today I Learned` page to keep track of these things!
