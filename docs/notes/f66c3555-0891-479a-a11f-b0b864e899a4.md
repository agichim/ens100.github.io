# Clojure Research

So, today was a day spent collecting my thoughts and trying to find various different sources of beginner Clojure information so that I could get my head around:

- What it is
- How it works
- What it can achieve
- How best to get started

What I like to do is to have an end vision in sight so that I have something to work towards, so that I can have a path and a point of where I want to go. I find that If I do not have this then I will spin my wheels for a long time and then lose focus and drive. 

So that being said, here are the few interesting links and readings that I found:

- <http://www.clojurenewbieguide.com/>
- <http://kimh.github.io/clojure-by-example/>
- <http://clojure-doc.org/>
- <https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/clojure/>
- <https://github.com/inclojure-org/clojure-by-example>
- <https://github.com/inclojure-org/intermediate-clojure-workshop>

What I set out to achieve today was to get an overall sense (or at least a grounding) of Clojure and what it can do. I think I was able to read up on this and satisfy my mind and curiosity. 

Tomorrow I will be reading into the various different Types that exist and how they operate from [here](https://aphyr.com/posts/302-clojure-from-the-ground-up-basic-types).
