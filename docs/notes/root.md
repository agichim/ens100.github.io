# Welcome

Hello ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my little corner of the world, my digital garden or second brain, where I nurture, curate and craft my ideas in an online manner.

The purpose of my digital garden is to try and go from a multitude of notes to the path of finding wisdom.

I set this up as part of my day to day life I come across a number of different topics which can somehow be interconnected. This led me to create a number of notes which were then safely stored in a structure of Folder -> subfolder -> subfolder -> note.

This process worked fine for a while but I would continuously struggle to find what I was looking for and the same note can find its home in a number of different topics. 

I'm fascinated with the world around us and I intend to write about various things such as:

- [Python  ](notes/9cabe777-4b21-4b94-be7b-0cd9a3f3de73)
- [Clojure  ](notes/6000b39f-04b1-4c49-b75b-dfa603889aa0)
- [Oil & Gas  ](notes/94a48961-dbe9-498b-b6e4-feb82b97c2e5)
- [Books ](notes/c992f0a7-674b-4114-9033-2ef3c1d45706)
- [Travel ](notes/b33e39c9-8443-41f7-94a6-9b34b046de55)
- [Things I learn ](notes/d24ab8b5-f3c0-4f59-8eb6-a17339b85b16)
- And a few others.

I hope to be able to share some of the wisdom I have gained through the new and improved note taking process. 

Thanks for stopping by and please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or comments.
