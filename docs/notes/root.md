# Welcome

Hello ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my little corner of the word, my digital garden or second brain, where I nurture, curate and craft my ideas in an online manner.

The purpose of my digital garden is to try and go from a multitude of notes to the path of finding wisdom.

I set this up as part of my day to day life I come across a number of different topics which can somehow be interconnected. This led me to create a number of notes which were then safely stored in a structure of Folder -> subfolder -> subfolder -> note.

This process worked fine for a while but I would continuously struggle to find what I was looking for and the same note can find its home in a number of different topics. 

I'm fascinated with the world around us and I intend to write about various things such as:

- Personal Knowledge
- Clojure
- Books
- Travel
- Things I learn
- And a few others.

I hope to be able to share some of the wisdom I have gained through the new and improved note taking process. 

Thanks for stopping by and please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or comments.
