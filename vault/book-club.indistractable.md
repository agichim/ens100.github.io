"The antidote to impulsiveness is forethought. Planning ahead ensures you will follow through." (Haidt et al :17)

"For me, it was the way I prioritized distractions over the most important people in my life." (Haidt et al :18)

"I had just blown a magical moment with my daughter because something on my phone had grabbed my attention. On its own, it was no big deal. But if I told you this was an isolated incident, I'd be lying. This same scene had played out countless times before." (Haidt et al :19)

"I kept getting distracted, even without the tech that I thought was the source of the problem." (Haidt et al :19)

"Removing online technology didn't work. I'd just replaced one distraction with another." (Haidt et al :19)

"We need to learn how to avoid distraction. Living the lives we want not only requires doing the right things but also necessitates not doing the things we know we'll regret. • The problem is deeper than tech. Being indistractable isn't about being a Luddite. It's about understanding the real reasons why we do things against our best interests. • Here's what it takes: We can be indistractable by learning and adopting four key strategies." (Haidt et al :22)

"Tantalus's curse is also our curse. We are compelled to reach for things we supposedly need but really don't. We don't need to check our email right this second or need to see the latest trending news, no matter how much we feel we must." (Haidt et al :27)

"Distraction stops you from achieving your goals. It is any action that moves you away from what you really want. • Traction leads you closer to your goals. It is any action that moves you toward what you really want." (Haidt et al :27)

"• Triggers prompt both traction and distraction. External triggers prompt you to action with cues in your environment. Internal triggers prompt you to action with cues within you." (Haidt et al :28)

"Unless we deal with the root causes of our distraction, we'll continue to find ways to distract ourselves. Distraction, it turns out, isn't about the distraction itself; rather, it's about how we respond to it." (Haidt et al :34)

"But by pinpointing the root cause, rather than blaming the proximate, she'll be better able to address the real issue next time." (Haidt et al :35)

"Understand the root cause of distraction. Distraction is about more than your devices. Separate proximate causes from the root cause. • All motivation is a desire to escape discomfort. If a behavior was previously effective at providing relief, we're likely to continue using it as a tool to escape discomfort. • Anything that stops discomfort is potentially addictive, but that doesn't make it irresistible. If you know the drivers of your behavior, you can take steps to manage them." (Haidt et al :36)

"Dissatisfaction is responsible for our species' advancements and its faults. To harness its power, we must disavow the misguided idea that if we're not happy, we're not normal—exactly the opposite is true. While this shift in mindset can be jarring, it can also be incredibly liberating." (Haidt et al :40)

"Time management is pain management. Distractions cost us time, and like all actions, they are spurred by the desire to escape discomfort. • Evolution favored dissatisfaction over contentment. Our tendencies toward boredom, negativity bias, rumination, and hedonic adaptation conspire to make sure we're never satisfied for long. • Dissatisfaction is responsible for our species' advancements as much as its faults. It is an innate power that can be channeled to help us make things better. • If we want to master distraction, we must learn to deal with discomfort." (Haidt et al :41)

"Without techniques for disarming temptation, mental abstinence can backfire. Resisting an urge can trigger rumination and make the desire grow stronger. • We can manage distractions that originate from within by changing how we think about them. We can reimagine the trigger, the task, and our temperament." (Haidt et al :45)

"By reimagining an uncomfortable internal trigger, we can disarm it. • Step 1. Look for the emotion preceding distraction. • Step 2. Write down the internal trigger. • Step 3. Explore the negative sensation with curiosity instead of contempt. • Step 4. Be extra cautious during liminal moments." (Haidt et al :49)

"We can master internal triggers by reimagining an otherwise dreary task. Fun and play can be used as tools to keep us focused. • Play doesn't have to be pleasurable. It just has to hold our attention. • Deliberateness and novelty can be added to any task to make it fun." (Haidt et al :53)

"Thankfully, you don't have to believe everything you think; you are only powerless if you think you are." (Haidt et al :59)

"Reimagining our temperament can help us manage our internal triggers. • We don't run out of willpower. Believing we do makes us less likely to accomplish our goals by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist. • What we say to ourselves matters. Labeling yourself as having poor self-control is self-defeating. • Practice self-compassion. Talk to yourself the way you'd talk to a friend. People who are more selfcompassionate are more resilient." (Haidt et al :59)

"Think of all the ways people steal your time. The Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote, "People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time, they are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy."" (Haidt et al :61)

"How much time in each domain would allow you to be consistent with your values? Start by creating a weekly calendar template for your perfect week." (Haidt et al :65)

"book fifteen minutes on your schedule every week to reflect and refine your calendar by asking two questions:" (Haidt et al :65)

"Question 1 (Reflect): "When in my schedule did I do what I said I would do and when did I get distracted?"" (Haidt et al :65)

"Question 2 (Refine): "Are there changes I can make to my calendar that will give me the time I need to better live out my values?"" (Haidt et al :65)

"By turning our values into time, we make sure we have time for traction. If we don't plan ahead, we shouldn't point fingers, nor should we be surprised when everything becomes a distraction. Being indistractable is largely about making sure you make time for traction each day and eliminating the distraction that keeps you from living the life you want—one that involves taking care of yourself, your relationships, and your work." (Haidt et al :66)

"You can't call something a distraction unless you know what it is distracting you from. Planning ahead is the only way to know the difference between traction and distraction. • Does your calendar reflect your values? To be the person you want to be, you have to make time to live your values. • Timebox your day. The three life domains of you, relationships, and work provide a framework for planning how to spend your time." (Haidt et al :66)

"• Reflect and refine. Revise your schedule regularly, but you must commit to it once it's set" (Haidt et al :67)

"Like every valuable thing, you require maintenance and care, which takes time. Just as you wouldn't blow off a meeting with your boss, you should never bail on appointments you make with yourself. After all, who's more critical to helping you live the kind of life you want than you?" (Haidt et al :68)

"We can start by prioritizing and timeboxing "you" time. At a basic level, we need time in our schedules for sleep, hygiene, and proper nourishment." (Haidt et al :69)

"The takeaway is that, when it comes to our time, we should stop worrying about outcomes we can't control and instead focus on the inputs we can. The positive results of the time we spend doing something is a hope, not a certainty." (Haidt et al :70)

"Schedule time for yourself first. You are at the center of the three life domains. Without allocating time for yourself, the other two domains suffer. • Show up when you say you will. You can't always control what you get out of time you spend, but you can control how much time you put into a task. • Input is much more certain than outcome. When it comes to living the life you want, making sure you allocate time to living your values is the only thing you should focus on." (Haidt et al :71)

"The people we love most should not be content getting whatever time is left over. Everyone benefits when we hold time on our schedule to live up to our values and do our share." (Haidt et al :75)

"The people you love deserve more than getting whatever time is left over. If someone is important to you, make regular time for them on your calendar. • Go beyond scheduling date days with your significant other. Put domestic chores on your calendar to ensure an equitable split." (Haidt et al :77)

"• A lack of close friendships may be hazardous to your health. Ensure you maintain important relationships by scheduling time for regular gettogethers." (Haidt et al :78)

"Whether at work, at home, or on our own, planning ahead and timeboxing our schedules is an essential step to becoming indistractable. By defining how we spend our time and syncing with the stakeholders in our lives, we ensure that we do the things that matter and ignore the things that don't. It frees us from the trivialities of our day and gives us back the time we can't afford to waste." (Haidt et al :84)

"Syncing your schedule with stakeholders at work is critical for making time for traction in your day. Without visibility into how you spend your time, colleagues and managers are more likely to distract you with superfluous tasks. • Sync as frequently as your schedule changes. If your schedule template changes from day to day, have a daily check-in. However, most people find a weekly alignment is sufficient." (Haidt et al :84)

"Is this trigger serving me, or am I serving it?" (Haidt et al :90)

"External triggers often lead to distraction. Cues in our environment like the pings, dings, and" (Haidt et al :90)

"rings from devices, as well as interruptions from other people, frequently take us off track. • External triggers aren't always harmful. If an external trigger leads us to traction, it serves us. • We must ask ourselves: Is this trigger serving me, or am I serving it? Then we can hack back the external triggers that don't serve us." (Haidt et al :91)

"Interruptions lead to mistakes. You can't do your best work if you're frequently distracted. • Open-office floor plans increase distraction. • Defend your focus. Signal when you do not want to be interrupted. Use a screen sign or some other clear cue to let people know you are indistractable." (Haidt et al :96)

"Break down the problem. Time spent on email (T) is a function of the number of messages" (Haidt et al :103)

"received (n) multiplied by the average time (t) spent per message: T = n × t. • Reduce the number of messages received. Schedule office hours, delay when messages are sent, and reduce time-wasting messages from reaching your inbox. • Spend less time on each message. Label emails by when each message needs a response. Reply to emails during a scheduled time on your calendar." (Haidt et al :104)

"Real-time communication channels should be used sparingly. Time spent communicating should not come at the sacrifice of time spent concentrating. • Company culture matters. Changing group chat practices may involve questioning company norms. We'll discuss this topic in part five." (Haidt et al :107)

"• Different communication channels have different uses. Rather than use every technology as an always-on channel, use the best tools for the job. • Get in and get out. Group chat is great for replacing in-person meetings but terrible if it becomes an all-day affair." (Haidt et al :108)

"Make it harder to call a meeting. To call a meeting, the organizer must circulate an agenda and briefing document. • Meetings are for consensus building. With few exceptions, creative problem-solving should occur before the meeting, individually or in very small groups. • Be fully present. People use devices during meetings to escape monotony and boredom, which subsequently makes meetings even worse. • Have one laptop per meeting. Devices in everyone's hands makes it more difficult to achieve the purpose of the meeting. With the exception of one laptop in the room for presenting information and taking notes, leave devices outside." (Haidt et al :112)

""think of your home page as a group of apps that you feel you are in charge of. If the app triggers any mindless checking from you, move it to a different screen."" (Haidt et al :115)

"You can hack back the external triggers on your phone in four steps and in less than one hour. • Remove: Uninstall the apps you no longer need. • Replace: Shift where and when you use potentially distracting apps, like social media and YouTube, to your desktop instead of on your phone. Get a wristwatch so you don't have to look at your phone for the time. • Rearrange: Move any apps that may trigger mindless checking from your phone's home screen. • Reclaim: Change the notification settings for each app. Be very selective regarding which apps can send you sound and sight cues. Learn to use your phone's Do Not Disturb settings." (Haidt et al :119)

"Desktop clutter takes a heavy psychological toll on your attention. Clearing away external" (Haidt et al :123)

"triggers in your digital workspace can help you stay focused. • Turn off desktop notifications. Disabling notifications on your computer ensures you won't get distract" (Haidt et al :124)

"Online articles are full of potentially distracting external triggers. Open tabs can pull us off course and tend to suck us down a time-wasting content vortex. • Make a rule. Promise yourself you'll save interesting content for later by using an app like Pocket. • Surprise! You can multitask. Use multichannel multitasking like listening to articles while working out or taking walking meetings." (Haidt et al :129)

"Feeds, like the ones we scroll through on social media, are designed to keep you engaged. Feeds are full of external triggers that can drive us to distraction. • Take control of feeds by hacking back. Use free browser extensions like News Feed Eradicator for Facebook, Newsfeed Burner, Open Multiple Websites, and DF Tube to remove distracting external triggers." (Haidt et al :134)

"Being indistractable does not only require keeping distraction out. It also necessitates reining ourselves in. • Precommitments can reduce the likelihood of distraction. They help us stick with decisions we've made in advance. • Precommitments should only be used after the other three indistractable strategies have already been applied. Don't skip the first three steps." (Haidt et al :139)

"An effort pact prevents distraction by making unwanted behaviors more difficult to do." (Haidt et al :140)

"An effort pact prevents distraction by making unwanted behaviors more difficult to do. • In the age of the personal computer, social pressure to stay on task has largely disappeared. No one can see what you're working on, so it's easier to slack off. Working next to a colleague or friend for a set period of time can be a highly effective effort pact. • You can use tech to stay off tech. Apps like SelfControl, Forest, and Focusmate can help you make effort pacts." (Haidt et al :144)

"A price pact adds a cost to getting distracted. It has been shown to be a highly effective motivator. • Price pacts are most effective when you can remove the external triggers that lead to distraction. • Price pacts work best when the distraction is temporary. • Price pacts can be difficult to start. We fear making a price pact because we know we'll have to actually do the thing we're scared to do. • Learn self-compassion before making a price pact." (Haidt et al :150)

"Identity greatly influences our behavior. People tend to align their actions with how they see themselves. • An identity pact is a precommitment to a self-image. You can prevent distraction by acting in line with your identity. • Become a noun. By assigning yourself a moniker, you increase the likelihood of following" (Haidt et al :157)

"through with behaviors consistent with what you call yourself. Call yourself "indistractable." • Share with others. Teaching others solidifies your commitment, even if you're still struggling. A great way to be indistractable is to tell friends about what you learned in this book and the changes you're making in your life. • Adopt rituals. Repeating mantras, keeping a timeboxed schedule, or performing other routines reinforces your identity and influences your future actions." (Haidt et al :158)

"Jobs where employees encounter high expectations and low control have been shown to" (Haidt et al :164)

"lead to symptoms of depression. • Depression-like symptoms are painful. When people feel bad, they use distractions to avoid their pain and regain a sense of control. • Tech overuse at work is a symptom of a dysfunctional company culture. • More tech use makes the underlying problems worse, perpetuating a "cycle of responsiveness."" (Haidt et al :165)

"Don't suffer in silence. A workplace where people can't talk about technology overuse is also one where people keep other important issues (and insights) to themselves. • Knowing that your voice matters is essential. Teams that foster psychological safety and facilitate regular open discussions about concerns not only have fewer problems with distraction but also have happier employees and customers." (Haidt et al :171)

"Indistractable organizations, like Slack and BCG, foster psychological safety, provide a place for open discussions about concerns, and, most important, have leaders who exemplify the importance of doing focused work." (Haidt et al :176)

"Stop deflecting blame. When kids don't act the way parents want, it's natural to look for answers that help parents divert responsibility. • Techno-panics are nothing new. From the book, to the radio, to video games, the history of parenting is strewn with moral panic over things supposedly making kids act in strange ways." (Haidt et al :182)

"• Tech isn't evil. Used in the right way and in the right amounts, kids' tech use can be beneficial, while too much (or too little) can have slightly harmful effects. • Teach kids to be indistractable. Teaching children how to manage distraction will benefit them throughout their lives." (Haidt et al :183)

"Internal triggers drive behavior. To understand how to help kids manage distraction, we need to start by understanding the source of the problem. • Our kids need psychological nutrients. According to a widely accepted theory of human motivation, all people need three things to thrive: a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. • Distractions satisfy deficiencies. When our kids' psychological needs are not met in the real world, they go looking for satisfaction—often in virtual environments. • Kids need alternatives. Parents and guardians can take steps to help kids find balance between their online and offline worlds by providing more offline opportunities to find autonomy, competence, and relatedness. • The four-part Indistractable Model is valuable for kids as well. Teach them methods for handling distraction, and, most important, model being indistractable yourself." (Haidt et al :191)

"Teach traction. With so many potential distractions in kids' lives, teaching them how to make time for traction is critical. • Just as with our own timeboxed schedules, kids can learn how to make time for what's important to them. If they don't learn to make their own plans in advance, kids will turn to distractions. • It's OK to let your kids fail. Failure is how we learn. Show kids how to adjust their schedules to make time to live up to their values." (Haidt et al :197)

"Distraction in social situations can keep us from being fully present with important people in" (Haidt et al :211)

"our lives. Interruptions degrade our ability to form close social bonds. • Block the spread of unhealthy behaviors. "Social antibodies" are ways groups protect themselves from harmful behaviors by making them taboo. • Develop new social norms. We can tackle distraction among friends the same way we beat social smoking, by making it unacceptable to use devices in social situations. Prepare a few tactful phrases—like asking, "Is everything OK?"—to discourage phone usage among friends." (Haidt et al :212)

"In short, we were making progress by using all four methods for becoming indistractable. We learned to cope with the stress of stopping our compulsion to use technology in the evening, and, over time, it became easier to resist. We scheduled a strict bedtime, claiming the bedroom as a sacred space and leaving external triggers, like our cell phones and the television, outside. The outlet timer that turned off the unwanted distractions made compliance with our precommitment something we came to expect every night. We began to use our reclaimed time for more "productive" purposes as we gained greater control over our habits." (Haidt et al :214)

"Distractions can take a toll on even our most intimate relationships; the cost of being able to connect with anyone in the world is that we might not be fully present with the person physically next to us." (Haidt et al :215)
