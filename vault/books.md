# Books

Having spent a number of years not opening or going close to a book, a few years ago, by chance, I picked up a book and struggled to put it down. It was literally a page turner.

I have now found a passion for reading and found that a good book will transport you through time, allowing you to converse with the greatest minds that ever were. My aim is to read (and process / understand) 12 books per year.

This patch of my digital garden will serve as the place where I review the books I have read. I try to read about a broad range of topics, so do not be surprised to find book reviews on business / finance, computer science, history, fiction and some self-help.
