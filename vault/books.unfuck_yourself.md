# Notes to sort

"While we have little or no say in those automatic and reactionary thoughts, we have a massive say in which of those same thoughts we attach significance to." (Bishop :15)

"In simple terms, the language you use to describe your circumstances determines how you see, experience and participate in them and dramatically affect how you deal with your life and confront problems both big and small." (Bishop :15)

"Negative self-talk can not only put us in a bad mood, it can leave us feeling helpless. It can make small problems seem bigger" (Bishop :16)

"your self-talk is fucking you over and in ways you can't even begin to imagine." (Bishop :16)

"Sometimes negative self-talk leads to anger, sadness, or frustration that manifests in different or seemingly unrelated situations." (Bishop :18)

"If you're sometimes talking about how "unfair" life is, you'll start to act according to that view, perceiving slights where none exist or, as studies have shown, putting less effort into your work because you've already determined it won't accomplish anything. The unfair view will quickly become your reality." (Bishop :19)

"On the other hand, the person who views success as if it were just around the corner will not only work his butt off to achieve it but be energized and alive to it and all the while acting on that fundamental view of success. To be clear, believing you will be successful is only one, (albeit important), part of success." (Bishop :19)

"Marcus Aurelius, the stoic philosopher turned Roman Emperor, said, "Here is a rule to remember in the future, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not 'This is misfortune,' but 'To bear this worthily is good fortune.'"" (Bishop :19)

""Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears."" (Bishop :19)

"people spend their lives waiting for the cavalry, all the while never realizing they are the cavalry. Your life is waiting on you to finally show up." (Bishop :20)

"starts by making a conscious choice to talk in a way that's helpful rather than harmful. By using the right kind of language and framing our problems in a more readily accessible light," (Bishop :21)

"Assertive self-talk is when you stake a claim for this moment of time, right here and now. When you start to talk in terms of "I am..." or "I embrace..." or "I accept..." or "I assert...", all of which are powerful and commanding uses of language rather than the narrative of "I will..." or "I'm going to..."" (Bishop :22)

"the true measure of who you are won't be found in your circumstances but rather the way in which you respond to them." (Bishop :31)

"Stop blaming luck. ing other people. to outside influences or circumstances. Stop blaming your childhood or neighborhood." (Bishop :31)

"To fully embrace my approach, you must first accept that while there are things have happened in your life that you had no say in, you are 100% responsible for what you do with your life in the aftermath of those events. Always, every time, no excuses." (Bishop :31)

"Fate leads the willing and drags along the reluctant"" (Bishop :32)

""In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing"" (Bishop :78)

"- Theodore Roosevelt" (Bishop :79)

"if you want to win, you have to be willing to be judged by others and not let it get to you. If you want to do something truly great, you'll have to accept that some people are going to think you're delusional or an idiot or righteous." (Bishop :82)

"you don't have to feel like today is your day, you just have to act like it is." (Bishop :93)

""I am not my thoughts; I am what I do"." (Bishop :99)

"The key to becoming relentless is to focus on the problem in front of you. Give it your full attention. Become someone who progresses even when all seems lost. The answer is always out there; all you need to do is find it." (Bishop :113)

"When you're not sure if you're following the right path, when you've been knocked down a few too many times, it's completely fine to get discouraged, hell; even defeated. What's not ok is to stop." (Bishop :114)

"When you expect nothing, you're living in the moment. You're not worrying about the future or rejecting the past. You're simply embracing your situation as it comes." (Bishop :129)

"You won't believe how much your interactions with other people will improve the moment you let go of expecting, the instant you learn to accept things as they happen." (Bishop :130)

"If there's" (Bishop :130)

"something you want, how about asking for it with no expectation? And when you do something positive or generous, do it because you genuinely want to rather than loading in the added weight of what you expect in return." (Bishop :131)

"Don't expect victory or defeat. Plan for victory, learn from defeat." (Bishop :132)

"Love the life you have, not the one you expected to have" (Bishop :132)

""I expect nothing and accept everything." This simple personal assertion gets you out of your head and powerfully into your life, out of your thoughts and into your reality. Problems, barriers, disagreements and disappointments are all part of every human beings' life." (Bishop :132)

"future you is not going to regret a lack of achievement or the absence of any one thing in your life. The only thing you will regret is not trying. Not striving. Not pushing through when the going got tough" (Bishop :140)

"YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE! If you did, you'd be doing it! Call yourself out on this shit." (Bishop :144)

"Take a long, hard look at your life. Be honest with yourself, identify the behaviors that are holding you back. You need to use every waking hour of your life to further your cause, no excuses. You're not any different or any worse off than anyone else. You're not a fucking special case who needs different rules than anyone else." (Bishop :144)

""I am relentless" doesn't mean relentlessly thinking or watching TV. It means relentlessly doing. Relentlessly taking action, pursuing your goals, acting and failing and ultimately succeeding." (Bishop :146)
