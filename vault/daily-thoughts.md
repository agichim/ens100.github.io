## My Daily Thoughts

In this area I summarise my daily thoughts and learnings. The purpose is to capture the key take-aways from each day in a bit of a summarised daily journal manner.

- With each day that passes <a href="https://www.dendron.so/" target="_blank">Dendron</a> becomes easier and easier to use and it has so many great features.
    - This digital garden for instance would have been so much more complicated to set up without it.

- I miss being able to [[travel]] and make our way hand-in-hand to the airport and board a flight somewhere to explore new areas.

- After having attempted to learn Clojure, I have decided to take a step back and try to learning something with more resources and "getting started" guides. 
    - I will therefore be learning [[Python | pkm.python]] as my first language and once I feel comfortable, I will develop my [[Clojure | pkm.clojure]] learning.

- With so many new tools out there it is very easy to be lead astray and keep procrastinating by continuously shifting between them, rather than using them for what they should be used...making life more productive.

- Rather than being in South Africa and Qatar we are at home. Bummer, but with everything going on it is nice to be safe and sound and to be able explore areas closer to home.
